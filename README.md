# SNGO
SNGO ( Structured Nonlinear Global Optimizer) is a global solver to solve structured (stochastic) optimization problems. Models are built using Plasmo.jl (https://github.com/jalving/Plasmo.jl).

# Developers
SNGO has been developed by 
    
    Yankai Cao, University of British Columbia 
    Victor M. Zavala, University of Wisconsin-Madison
    
SNGO has been updated from Julia 0.6.0 to Julia 1.4.0 by
    
    Riley Ballachay, University of British Columbia
